#+title: OCaml values in Gospel terms
Most of the time, OCaml values, are not allowed to be used in [[id:27926a9e-056a-43bb-886e-37f4a973bf98][Gospel]]
terms.  The only exception is within [[id:31e9f9d7-e378-45c1-a2d4-f8e24a3ea416][OCaml value specifications]] when
they are explicitly consumed, produced or preserved.  Otherwise, they
are not considered to be in scope and are not allowed to be used.
Within the Gospel term, they their type is their corresponding logical
representation.
