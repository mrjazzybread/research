#+title: Gospel mutable types

Like in [[id:b3f8eb53-1b01-487c-aeaa-4d8c7574e836][OCaml]], [[id:27926a9e-056a-43bb-886e-37f4a973bf98][Gospel]] also provides a ~mutable~ keyword.  Unlike in
OCaml, which uses it to talk about individual record fields, Gospel
uses it to mark types whose logical [[id:79d0fef4-20f0-45af-9b03-e189534b420c][model]] changes over time.  If a
type is marked as
#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment ocamlenv
#+begin_example ocaml
type t
(*@ mutable
    model : integer *)
#+end_example

Then the ~integer~ representation of ~t~ can change.  All ~mutable~ types
are OCaml types that contain values that can change over time.  If a
type does not have a ~mutable~ tag, then its model remains constant.
