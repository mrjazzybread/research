#+title: Logical relations for formally verified authenticated data structures
* Motivation

Outsourcing data to outside parties without losing data integrity.

Authenticated data structures can be compiled from the
non-authenticated implementation.

Authenticated data structures could be implemented as a library

* Goals

Creating two logical relations and a proof of security and correctness
of this library.

Verifying a particular client of this library is not difficult, the
tricky is thing is to prove that any well typed client is well behaved.

* Approach

To show security and correctness, they define a new Separation Logic
binary and ternary relations for security and correctness.


* Collision free reasoning

Introduces a hashed resource which assumes no hash collisions.
