#+title: RefinedProsa Connecting Response-Time Analysis with C Verification for Interrupt Free Schedulers
* Motivation

Timing correctness is crucial for real time system.

Schedualibility analysis checks f the abstract modal is free of errors,
but provides no guarantees that the abstract model coincides with the
concrete implementation.

Interrupt free schedulers are common in practice for reasons.

* Contribution

RefinedProsa: a connection between refinedC and Rocq

* Proof overview

How to reason over time in C, an untimed language?

We create marker functions that are associated with time stamps.

* Rossl's scheduling loop

Use marker functions to define basic actions

* Rocq

We associate the list of marker functions with a list of timestamps.
