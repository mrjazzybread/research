#+title: Iris invariants

In [[id:156425db-a11c-4efb-8bdc-3fedbe4a7268][Iris]], in order to share spatial predicates among several threads,
we use invariants: persistent resources.

An invariant can be made out of any proposition, this means that we
can create nested invariants.

Hoare triples now have associated with them a precondition, a
postcondition and the set of invariant names.

The resources to run a program described by some Hoare Triple can
either be in the precondition or in any of the invariants accessible
by the triple.

To open an invariant, we it must be in the set of invariant names we
are allowed to access.  Once opened, it can be used for a single
atomic step.  Additionally, it cannot be opened again.

We need a stronger frame rule that allows us to frame a resource that
is accessed later when the expression /e/ is an atomic expression.
