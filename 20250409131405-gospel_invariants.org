#+title: Gospel type invariants
A type can have a [[id:27926a9e-056a-43bb-886e-37f4a973bf98][Gospel]] type invariant if any of the following
criteria are met:

- It is a Gospel type
- It is an OCaml type with at least a single [[id:79d0fef4-20f0-45af-9b03-e189534b420c][model]] field (or a default
  model).

When we have an OCaml type with no [[id:79d0fef4-20f0-45af-9b03-e189534b420c][models]], there is no representation
for it in Gospel specifications, meaning there is no meaningful
invariant one can express for this type
