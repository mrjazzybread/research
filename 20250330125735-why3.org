#+title: Why3
Why3 is a tool tailored for [[id:a71bff28-7d04-4241-80da-e8f58d98960b][deductive program verification]]. It
generates proof obligations from programs written in WhyML, its
dedicated specification and programming language. These proof
obligations are in turn proved either with an [[id:8f29335f-55b9-4a20-bb2f-f3feb8807d02][SMT solver]] (most
commonly Alt-ergo, CVC, Z3) or a proof assistant such as [[id:04859df3-6922-4c19-b7f2-ce7988a4484b][Rocq]].
