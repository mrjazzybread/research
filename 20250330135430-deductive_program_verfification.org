#+title: Deductive program verification
Deductive program verification is the process of ensuring that some
program satisfies a given specification. This is done using some proof
environment that generate proof obligations and subsequently
discharging them using some verification platform, most commonly
either automated theorem provers or interactive proof assistants.
