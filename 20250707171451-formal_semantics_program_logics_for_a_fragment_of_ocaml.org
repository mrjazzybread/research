#+title: Formal Semantics & Program Logics for a Fragment of OCaml
* Contributions

- Using [[id:04859df3-6922-4c19-b7f2-ce7988a4484b][Rocq]] to formalize the semantics of OLang, a sequential
  fragment of [[id:b3f8eb53-1b01-487c-aeaa-4d8c7574e836][OCaml]].
- A translation of OCaml to OLang.
- Two program logics, Horus and [[id:19514cee-4f8b-4dd9-a19f-2b5a4dfc86f0][Osiris]], to reason over OLang.  The
  former reasons over pure programs while the other reasons over
  effectful programs.  Proofs in one logic can be used in another.

Osiris is the first program logic to support OCaml's combination of
effects and exceptions.
