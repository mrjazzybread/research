#+title: Gospel Separation Logic semantics
Since [[id:27926a9e-056a-43bb-886e-37f4a973bf98][Gospel]] is meant to be used by a variety of proof environments,
it must provide some intermediate representation so that each tool
that interfaces with Gospel interprets its specifications in the same
way.  Likewise, these tools must easily be able to easily integrate
this representation into their proof pipeline.  To do this, we use
[[id:aaab620a-b308-4e61-b8f6-2bb38e7ad156][Separation Logic]] to provide meaning to Gospel specifications.
