#+title: Heap Lang 2.0
* Motivation

A researcher wants to verify something complicated like data races or
networks.

To do this, users have to define their own custom languages

Heap lang is neat, but not very extensible.

Heap lang = memory model + pure \lambda-calculus

* Semantic extensions

Semantic extensions include extensions to the effects allowed.

To compose semantic extensions, the memory model must be aware of
other extensions.  Must universally quantify over extensions.

* Itrees

what are they

* Atomic operations

There are many atomic operations which every memory model would have
to re-implement all these.

Atomic blocks allow to reuse atomic operations in different memory
models (not very detailed explanation).

Atomic triples are just regular triples with a token that witnesses
that this is an atomic operation.
