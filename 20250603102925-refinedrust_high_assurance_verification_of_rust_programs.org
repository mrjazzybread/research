#+title: RefinedRust: high-assurance verification of Rust programs
* Rust

Folks, it's a language.

* RefinedRust

To turn rustbelt, A semantic model for rust, into a verification tool,
it is combined with refinedc.

* Goal

Verify memory safety of unsafe code and functional correctness.

* How does RefinedRust work

Rust code is combined with user annotations and is compiled wiht the
rust compiler and the refined rust frontend.  RefinedRust
specifications are turned into types.
