#+title: Hoare Logic
Hoare Logic is the main reasoning framework through which [[id:a71bff28-7d04-4241-80da-e8f58d98960b][deductive
program verification]] is done with. The most important logical
construct of this logic are /Hoare Triples/ such as \[\{P\}\ s\
\{\lambda x.Q\}\],
where \[P\] describes the possible states the program \[s\] is allowed
to be executed in and \[\lambda x.\ Q \] is a predicate parameterised by the
return value of \[s\] that describes the state of the program at the
end of \[s\].

In order to deduce if a /Hoare Triple/ is correct, one of the most
commonly used tactic is some variant of /weakest precondition
calculus/. Given a postcondition \[Q\] and a program \[s\], it computes
the most general (weakest) precondition \[P'\] for which the triple
\[\{P'\}s\{Q\}\] holds and checks if \[P \xrightarrow{} P'\] where
\[P\] is the user supplied precondition.
